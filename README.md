# Hate Speech Classification

A school project for the fictional organization The Equal Web, focused on utilizing Natural Language Processing for the classification of textual sequences as normal, offensive, or hate speech. The implementation utilizes a Transformer architecture-based model known as HateXplain, hosted on Hugging Face. The project underwent the usual phases of the CRISP-DM cycle, which modelling phase's results are shown in this repository's Jupyter Notebook file. While the model is pre-trained and available for use out of the box, it also underwent a fine-tuning to vastly improve the model's accuracy for this project's specific use case.
